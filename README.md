<<<<<<< HEAD# images_hyperspectrales

The file main.py regroups every core functions developed to automatically detect and 
extract grains, display figures, store data into a csv folder and use deep learning.

IHS_grains_EMA.py is the initial file.

gala folder has been left for watershed algorithm.

In the other python files, every function has been described and regrouped
by use, for example, crop_img.py has every function to deal with the extraction
of grains.

Everything has been thought to be automatised given a folder where hyperspectral 
images are stored. The address "D:\\Etude technique" is an example.

The csv folder regroups every intermediate result done in order to accelerate 
computing time by loading values already calculated.
